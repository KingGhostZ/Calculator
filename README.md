The calculator allows for users to continuously enter numbers and operands each time they enter it in the text boxes and press OK. 

The calculator will perform the calculation depending on the operand that is introduced. The result is then stored into an array and the min, max, avg, and total is taken of all
the results that have taken place. 

Once a user presses cancel, the input options are taken away and an external user can save the webpage or print it out this way.
